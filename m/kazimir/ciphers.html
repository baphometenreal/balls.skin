<h1>Ciphers</h1>

<h2>Versailles Cipher</h2>
<p>The Versailles Cipher is a relatively simple block transposition cipher I designed in June 2023. It is based on <a href="https://www.tileshop.com/products/bucak-light-walnut-honed-filled-large-versailles-pattern-travertine-floor-tile-657575">a relatively common variety of the Versailles tile pattern</a>, although in theory one could base the cipher off of any irregular pattern of rectangles.</p>
<p>The route taken for the transposition begins in the top-left block of whichever pattern is being used, and fills in this block in scanline order. Once this block is full, the cipher continues in the next empty block in terms of scanline order, until the tiling unit is complete, at which point a new block is started.</p>
<p>As an example, here is the first sentence of <a href="https://finwake.com/1024chapter1/1024finn1.htm">Finnegans Wake</a> written in the Versailles Cipher, supplemented with filler letters:</p>
