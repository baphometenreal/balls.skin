<p>What is progressivism? Most would say that it’s a political position. That’s how it <i>manifests</i> nowadays, but that it’s not what it <i>is</i>. What is it really?
<p>At its core, progressivism is not an ideology, but rather a thought process. To be progressive is to refuse to settle for the status quo.
    To be progressive is to embrace positive change, even if it’s “unnatural”.
    To be progressive is to dare to tell one’s lizard brain to fuck off, and to make one’s decisions
    and to form one’s opinions based upon logic and knowledge rather than upon instinct and tradition.</p>
<p>The world’s first progressive was whoever first made fire.</p>
