		<h1>Death finished and Turku reset</h1>
		<h2>25th of July, 2024
		<p>i forgot to publish this yesterday waaa</p>
		<p>i finally finished Death (its on my bandcamp! ^^). i dont think i could ever make another death album without going through alot of horrible stuff again (and i obviously hope i wont), sense death was made as a huge overarching vent album.</p>
		<p>i never planned on death being dragged out this long but it is what it is, im glad that the people who like it like it and i hope they enjoy death is not true bliss.</p>
		<p>i have been slowly working on a minecraft map of turku (the capital of my country in a collab worldbuilding project) with friends and i decided it would probably be better to actually plan things out and reset.</p>
