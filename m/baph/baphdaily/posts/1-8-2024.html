		<h1>bugcried more like uh erm uh</h1>
		<h2>1st of August, 2024
		<p>i found bugcried a hyperpop? breakcore? cover/remix artist a few months ago and today realized that all their music on spotify had been removed for one reason or another, and today i had spent a few hours with sapero and kaz to try and find as much of it as i can and we found 13 songs that had been removed and reuploaded them all to youtube as well as reuploading got ur number and figure 8 to be safe.</p>
		<p>unrelated i have been playing my 3ds more and realized i could play xenogears on my 3ds bc retroarch is on it and stuff so i have been slowly playing that off and on the past 3 days</p>
		<p>i forgot to write a baphomet daily yesterday which sucks</p>
