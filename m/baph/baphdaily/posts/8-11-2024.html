		<h1>Japanese study day 0</h1>
		<h2>8th of November, 2024</h2>
		<p>Last night i had an idea for something i could do to distract myself from the current horror that is happening in the US, something i've tried off and on for 6 years at this point, ""properly"" learn Japanese. Japanese is a pretty hard language for people who don't already speak an east Asian language, but i've tried (and failed) for several years at this point to learn both the Japanese language and Korean, and if you know me well enough youd know i also have Cantonese "family" who have tried to teach me Cantonese, so i have a vague idea of both what i need to do to get better, and what i don't know. i would definitly call myself a noob when it comes to the actual language however. i plan on changing that within the next 4 years (or, at least try to).</p>
		<h3 id="goals">What are my goals</h3>
		<p>My goals for this are fairly straight forward; learn enough Japanese to be able to understand and speak it with natives and to be able to engage with Japanese media i personally enjoy, i.e. NGE and SMT. there is still a lot of Japanese media in those two franchises alone that is still untranslated and completely in its original Japanese text, and i want to see what those pieces of media have to offer, as i like them a lot. a more tertiary goal i have with this is to give me something to do daily that will work to a short long term goal that would be genuinelly benifitial for me to do, instead of rotting my life away every day. one extremely long term goal with this is to visit Japan one day.</p>
		<p> A year into this project i hope to (try) to read a Japanese light novel series called Evangelion ANIMA, i have read the English version before and i really like it and i want to try to read it in its native Japanese as well.</p>
		<h3 id="resources">How am i going to do this</h3>
		<p>As i've said before, i've tried to learn Japanese off and on for years at this point, so i know my way around a lot of the resources for the language, and sense i'm in a fairly unique starting place, how will i actually learn anything?</p>
		<p>For starters, i'll use the ankideck series <a class="jalink" href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/by-author/1678635361">core 2k/6k with audio</a> with these deck settings daily:</p>

		<img class="jaimg" src=./8-11-2024/2.png>
		<img class="jaimg" src=./8-11-2024/3.png>
		<p>i'll use the plugin anki advanced review bottom bar <a class="jalink" href="https://github.com/noobj2/Anki-Advanced-Review-Bottombar">(here)</a> with the hard and good buttons hidden, so that not remembering a word is a lot more punishing, but remembering it is more rewarding in a way.</p>
		<img class="jaimg" src=./8-11-2024/4.png>
		<p>the core 2k/6k deck will carry a large part of the begining of this journey, with it giving me 5 new words daily and at most 600 words to review every day. I also plan on using duolingo's Japanese course for supplementary learning, more as a first thing in the morning to get me in Japanese brain before i do my anki deck.</p>
		<p>I also plan on reading through most if not all of <a class="jalink" href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/">Tae Kim's guide to learning Japanese</a> and <a class="jalink" href="https://jref.com/articles/japanese-grammar-part-1.13/">Jref's Japanese grammar</a> and reviewing their contents more at my own pace unlike duolingo and anki, going back and forth between lessons ive already looked at to ensure i understand their contents.</p>
		<h3>what is the end game</h3>
		<p>about a year in, once i've read about half of Tae's lessons i will try to take mock exams of the <a class="jalink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test">JLPT</a> 5 and 4 if i pass JLPT 5, about 2 years in i'll try for 4 and 3, a year after that 2 and after that 1. While im not optimizing for the JLPT even slighlty, it will be a good way to see where I am with learning Japanese roughly, and as i clear and master the core 2k/6k i'll begin reading Evangelion ANIMA and adding any new words i come across if i come across any to a seperate "new words" anki deck with the same settings as the core 2k/6k deck that i'll gradually add to with other pieces of Japanese media i come across. My goal with adding new words is that i actually remember these new words and don't forget them, even if they're "not important" because i'd rather know that word then not.</p>
		<p>After these 4 upcoming years, i will likely continue learning Japanese and reviewing the decks i've mentioned, but i don't know how that process will hold up, and whether i'll need to rethink how i am learning Japanese afterwards. I believe how i have this planned out will work for me, and i don't know if this system will work for others or not and i won't even try to claim that it will. i don't even care if this is an inneficiant way of learning the language, it's more about making it enjoyable for me so i can consistantly do this daily for the next 4 years. it's more about ensuring i have fundamental Japanese language knowledge that i can easily expand as well.</p>
		<h3 >final words</h3>
		<p>whether i stick with this or not, i have no idea, but for now i do plan on doing this, and i plan on updating you guys at least weekly, possibly daily but we'll see how much time that takes up for me, about my progress with this.</p>
		<p>all i can do is hope that this works for me and i can achieve my goals with this attempt at learning Japanese finally after all these tries</a>
