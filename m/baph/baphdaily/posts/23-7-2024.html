		<h1>First Baphomet Daily, Death progress and therapy</h1>
		<h2>23rd of July, 2024
		<p>Hi! This is the first of hopefully many Baphomet Daily's, this will basically be a public diary of sorts explaining what i did that day and things i worked on. this is mostly for me because i do have memory problems and i hope this will help somewhat if i have something to write these thoughts in.</p>
		<p>i cant promise this will be a daily thing but i will definitly try my best to make it daily</p>
		<p>i made some more progress with the (genuinelly) final death album by remaking the cover with eso and working on a few songs. </p> <p>i think i made some huge progress in therapy by talking about [redacted] and how he treated me and how that made me feel, i did cry a lot though. </p><p>i also finished the Baphian dictionary and i hope to make some more words for it soon.</p>
