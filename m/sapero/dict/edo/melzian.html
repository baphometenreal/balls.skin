<b>mu</b> <b>4</b> [ ˥ ] in <b>mu</b> [ ˥ ] <b>dia</b> [ ˥ ] to stand; to stop. Idiom.: <b>iy-ow</b>- <b>ɔkpa</b> <b>mu</b> <b>dia</b> [ ˩ ˥ / ˥ ˩ ˥ ] “I stand on one leg”: I have not yet reached a decision (in a palaver, or in any problem). <b>mu</b> [ ˥ ] <b>dia</b> [ ˥ ] <b>na</b> [ ˥ ] to stand bail for some- body; <b>mu</b> <b>dia</b> <b>mɛ‿itey-owa</b> <b>re</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˦ ] “stand bail for me until I go home and return”, i.e. until I have returned; <b>ɔʋ̃a</b> <b>n-imu</b> <b>dia</b> <b>na</b> <b>lɛ</b> <b>fua</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˩ ˥ / / ] the man for whom I stood bail has run away (which is said to happen often). <b>mu</b> [ ˥ ] <b>dia</b> [ ˥ ] <b>xɛ</b> [ / ] to wait for somebody; <b>mu</b> <b>dia</b> <b>xɛ</b> <b>ʋ̃ɛ-ɣ-ide</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ / ] “wait for me for I am coming”!

<b>muegbɛdoo</b> [ ˥ ˦ ˧ / ] a bird, rather big, similar to <b>idu</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] (a dove); cries at night, and in the evening and morning. Its cry, believed to be caused by worm- bite, is interpreted as “(I am) ready for Benin”, i.e. a cry to affirm its willingness to go and serve the <b>Ɔba</b>, while, on the other hand, the worms that in Bini belief cause it to cry are <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspthought to be a punishment for a previous refusal to serve the <b>Ɔba</b>. Another interpretation is a mockery directed at boys whose mouth is affected by yaws: <b>(u)nu</b> <b>ofiofio</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˥ ˥ ‿ / ] (<i>cf.</i> <b>ofi</b> [ ˩ ˥ ]). The bird is also called <b>osaikpe</b> [ ˩ / / ]. <br>

<b>(e)n-</b> <b>1</b> relative particle (not in- dispensable); the following pro- noun which is closely linked up with it has low tone in the ipf. and high tone in the pf., e.g. <b>n-ɔɽu‿ɛe</b> [ ˩ ˥ \ ] who does; <b>n</b>- <b>ɔɽu‿ɛe</b> [ ˥ ˥ \ ] who did; in the plural, <b>i</b> can be used with the relative particle, e.g. <b>ekita</b> <b>n-ibũ</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˩ ˩ ˥ ] many dogs (dogs that are numerous). <br>

<b>n-</b> <b>2</b> a particle conveying, to- gether with a particular con- struction (auxiliary <b>ya</b> [ ˩ ]; tense- particle <b>-a</b> [ ˥ ]), the idea ex- pressed by the English “instead of doing...”; <b>n-u-ayaɽu‿ɛe</b>, <b>ukelɛ</b> <b>fua</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˥ \ ˩ \ ˩ / ] instead of doing it you ran away. Possibly the particle is identical with <b>(e)n-</b> <b>1</b>, and the sentence a re- lative clause. <br>

<b>(e)n-</b> <b>3</b> particle introducing a sub- junctive (with a high or mid- tone pronoun); <b>ɔw-en-iɽu‿ɛe</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˦ (4-1) ] (<b>wɛ</b> [ / ]) he told me to do it. <br>

<b>na</b> <b>1</b> [ ˥ ] (1) to give; the verb has three other different forms em- bodying the objective pronouns <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspof the singular, viz. <b>mɛ</b> [ ˥ ] (to give me), <b>nuɛ</b>, <b>nwuɛ</b> [ / ] (to give you), and <b>nɛ</b> [ \ ] (to give him), e.g. in <b>ɔrhi-ɛɽe</b> <b>mɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ (4-1) ˥ ] he gave it me; <b>irhi-ɛɽe</b> <b>nwuɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ (4-1) / ] I gave it you; <b>irhi-ɛɽe</b> <b>nɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ / \ ] I am giving it him; (2) also ex- presses that something is done for somebody: <b>ɔɽu‿ɛe</b> <b>nɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ / (4-1) ] he did it for him; <b>n-ɔʋ̃a</b> <b>n-ima</b> <b>nwina</b> <b>na</b> <b>ɣiʋo</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ \ ˩ / ] where is the man for whom we are working?; <i>cf.</i> <b>mɛ</b> [ ˥ ], <b>nɛ</b> [ \ ], <b>nwuɛ</b> [ / ]. <br>

<b>na</b> <b>2</b> [ ˥ ] to tell; to narrate (to somebody: <b>ma</b> [ / ]); <b>ɣɛna‿ɛ̃</b> <b>ma</b> <b>ʋ̃ɛ-ɣ-iho</b> <b>n-ihɔ̃</b> [ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˩ ˥ / / ˦ ˩ ] don’t tell it me for I don’t want to hear (it). <b>n-erhuʋ̃u</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˩ ] to bless (somebody: <b>na</b> [ ˥ ]); occasionally the blessing is accompanied by the speaker taking his <b>exwae</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] and blowing over it in the direction of the man whom he blesses (curses are emphasised by touching one’s lips with the lips and then spitting); <b>ɔn-erhuʋ̃u</b> <b>nɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˩ \ ] he blessed him. <b>n-inyɛ</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] to gossip; to defame; <b>ɣɛɣin-iny-oʋi‿ɛrɛe</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˦ (3-1) ] don’t defame somebody else’s son! <br>

<b>na</b> <b>3</b> [ ˥ ] in <b>n-ema</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] to tie the yam branches to the yam poles (<b>ikpɛsi</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ] and <b>ɛɣɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ]) by means of ropes or creepers (<b>ikã</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] e.g.) in order to spread them out; <b>ɔy-ugbo</b> <b>n-odɛ</b> <b>ya</b> <b>n-ema</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ \ ˩ / ˥ ˩ ] he went to the farm yesterday to (go and) tie the yam branches up; <i>cf.</i> <b>inema</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ]; <i>v.</i> <b>ha‿ema</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ], <b>vi-ab</b>- <b>ema</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ]. <br>

<b>na</b> <b>4</b> [ ˥ ] an auxiliary verb used in relative clauses when the rela- tion is a temporal, causal, or <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsplocal one: “when”; “where”; “therefore”; <b>ʋ-ɛɣɛ</b> <b>n-inare</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ \ ˥ ] at the time when I came; <i>v.</i> <b>ya</b> <b>2</b> [ ˥ ]. <br>

<b>na</b> [ ˩ ] (1) attributive demonstra- tive pronoun: “this”; preceded by a high tone, e.g. <b>ɔʋ̃a</b> <b>na</b> [ ˩ / ˩ ] this man. (2) at the end of a sentence it means something like “now”, but perhaps it implies a notion of locality as well; <b>ukpɔ̃‿</b> <b>uxiɛ̃</b> <b>na</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] are you selling cloth now, i.e. as you are standing here; with <b>nia</b> [ / ] in- stead of <b>na</b>, it would mean: are you selling now or not? e.g. when the man addressed is fidgetting with the cloth; <i>cf.</i> <b>ɔna</b> [ ˩ ˩ ]; <i>v.</i> <b>ni</b> [ / ]. <br>

<b>n-aka</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] (1) middle (?); only in <b>ɛd-ekɛ̃</b> <b>n-aka</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] the day inter- mediate between two rest-days, i.e. the second day after each rest-day (<b>ekɛ̃</b> [ ˩ ˥ ]); perhaps it means, however, originally “the minor <b>ekɛ̃</b>.” (2) mild; innocuous; in <b>amɛ</b> <b>n-aka</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] mild rain, and, perhaps, in <b>ɛnyɛ</b> <b>n-aka</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] grass-snake; <i>cf.</i> <b>(e)ne</b> [ \ ]. <br>

<b>(e)ne</b> [ ˥ ] or [ \ ] a demonstrative element apparently to some extent equivalent to the English definite article; it is always put in front of the noun qualified by it, but if the noun is followed by the name of a locality, the <b>ne</b> stands before this, e.g. <b>Ɔxwahɛ</b> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<b>n-ixuɛ̃</b> [ ˩ / ˩ \ ˩ ] “the <b>Ɔxwahɛ</b> of <b>Ixuɛ̃</b>”. It occurs also in a reduplicated form: <b>nene</b> [ ˥ ˦ ] which probably is more em- phatic, e.g. <b>n-ɔʋ̃a</b> [ ˥ (4-1) ] “the man (spoken of)”, <b>nen-ɔʋ̃a</b> [ ˥ ˦ (3-1) ] “that very man”. If a noun is re- peated with the <b>ne</b> placed be- tween the two repetitions, the meaning of the noun is aug- mented by the notion “big”, or “real, main, principal”, e.g. <b>imazɛ</b> <b>y-ɔʋ̃a</b> <b>n-ɔʋ̃a-ɽe</b>, <b>amaw</b>- <b>uwɛ</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˥ ˩ ˩ ˥ / ˩ ˥ ˩ \ ˩ ] (<b>wɛ</b> [ / ]) I do not mind a big (i.e. important) man, how much less you; <b>inwina</b> <b>n-inwina‿inwina</b> <b>nɛ</b> <b>na</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ \ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˥ / ˩ ] something like “this is a good job of work I did for him”. When preceding nouns expressing time like <b>ɛdɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] “day”, <b>ɛɣɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ] “time”, <b>ukpo</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] “year”, it conveys the idea of “ago”, e.g. <b>n-ɛdɛ</b> [ \ ˥ ] or [ ˥ ˦ ] “in the old time”, “in the old days”, as in <b>ɛkpo</b> <b>n-ɛdɛ</b> <b>ot-uwa</b> <b>na‿iherh-ũkpɔ̃</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˦ ˧ ˩ ˥ / ˩ ˥ ˥ ˥ ˩ ] “in the old times your age-group did not yet wear cloth” (to a young boy); fur- ther: <b>n-ukpo</b> [ \ ˩ ] “last year” (<i>cf.</i> <b>ukpo</b> <b>na</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] or <b>n-ukpo</b> <b>na</b> “this year”), with the forms <b>n-ɛkp-ia</b> [ ˥ (4-1) ‿ / ] “two years ago”, lit. “three-years ago”, as the current year is included in the calculation, <b>n-ɛkp-enɛ</b> [ ˥ ˦ ˧ ] “three (lit. four) years ago”, <b>n-ɛkp-isɛ̃</b> [ ˥ ˦ ˧ ] “four (lit. five) years ago”, etc.; <i>v.</i> <b>n-ɛv-</b> [ ˥ ], <b>ɛɣɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ], <b>ɛdɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], <b>nodɛ</b> [ \ ˩ ]. Finally, <b>ne</b> is often used in front of the ordinal numbers, e.g. in <b>n-okao</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] “the first”, <b>n-ogieva</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˩ ] “the second”, etc. which can also (without the exception <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspof “the first”) occur preceded by <b>ukp-</b>, as e.g. in <b>n-ukp-ogieha</b> [ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˩ ] “the third”. <br>

<b>n-ema</b> [ ˥ ˩ ]; <i>cf.</i> <b>na</b> <b>3</b> [ ˥ ]. <br>

<b>n-erhuʋ̃u</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˩ ]; <i>cf.</i> <b>na</b> <b>2</b> [ ˥ ]. <br>

<b>nɛ</b> <b>1</b> [ ˥ ] to defaecate; <b>ɛnɛ</b> [ / \ ] he is constipated. <br>

<b>nɛ</b> <b>2</b> [ ˥ ] already; often used after <b>fo</b> [ / ] “finished”, but also after other verbs; <b>ɔfo</b> <b>nɛ</b> <b>ɽa</b> [ ˩ ˥ (4-1) ˩ ] is it already finished? <br>

<b>nɛ</b> [ ˩ ] “he” and “it”, when followed by <b>ʋo</b> [ / ] “where is”; <i>cf.</i> also <b>lɛ</b> [ ˩ ]; <b>iɽ̃ɛ̃</b> [ ˩ ˩ ] is also used, but only of human beings, while <b>nɛ</b> is used of things mostly; <b>nɛ</b> <b>ʋo</b> [ ˩ / ] where is it? <br>

It is also used after a relative sen- tence, e.g. <b>ɔʋ̃a</b> <b>n-ɔre</b> <b>ni</b> <b>ɔse</b> <b>ʋ̃ɛ</b> <b>nɔ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˥ / ˩ ˩ ˥ ˦ ] “that man who has come (or, ‘the man who has come there’?) is my friend”. Further, it is used after other verbal forms: <b>uxiã</b> <b>ni</b> [ ˥ ˦ / ] someting like: “are you going over there?” or, “you over there, are you going?” <i>cf.</i> <b>ɔni</b> (<b>ɔɽ̃ĩ</b>) [ ˥ / ]; <i>v.</i> <b>na</b> [ ˩ ]. <br>

<b>ogwɛga</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ] (1) a tree, <i>Detarium</i> <i>senegalense</i>, also called <b>erh</b>- <b>õgwɛga</b> [ ˩ ˥ (4-1) ˩ ]; the seed is broken in two parts and put on strings (four halves on each string) as an instrument for divining. There is another tree bearing the name <b>ogwɛg-odĩ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˩ ], “the deaf <b>ogwɛga</b>”, <i>Klainedoxa</i> <i>gabo</i>- <i>nensis</i>; its fruit is used as a substitute for the <b>ogwɛga</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ] proper, though it is not believed to be as useful for the oracle. Another substitute is the fruit of the <b>axwɛxwɛ</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˥ ] tree. (2) the method of divination (<i>v.</i> also <b>ominigbɔ̃</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ]) in which the seeds of the above-mentioned tree are used. The instrument of divination consists of four strings each of which contains four <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsphalves of the seed. At one end of each string a small bell (<b>ɛɽoɽo</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˥ ]) and some cowries are fastened. The diviner (<b>ɔb-ogwɛga</b> [ ˩ ˥ (4-1) ˩ ]) seizes one end of each string and throws them with the intention of turning them upside down. The subsequent arrange- ment of seeds is then analysed (<i>v.</i> <b>eria</b> [ ˩ ˥ ]) according to a certain code (<b>itie</b> [ ˩ ˥ ]), the criterion being the “open” or “covered” position of the seed-halves. The analysis is said to proceed at first from the right side to the left, and, after that, in the opposite direction, but as if the arrange- ment were looked at from the other end of the strings. The different positions have names, e.g. <b>odĩ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] is a string with the two outer seed-halves showing their inside, and the two inner halves showing their cover. (Under the headings dealing with these positions, o. will mean “open”, and c. “covered”+, as reckoned from the top of the string.) The names of the positions are: <b>odĩ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], <b>oɣoi</b> [ ˩ ˩ ] <b>oɽuhu</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ], <b>ɔɣae</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], <b>ogbi</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] <b>ako</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], <b>ose</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], <b>ohũ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] <b>ɛrhoxwa</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ], <b>ɛka</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], <b>ɔkã</b> [ ˩ ˩ ] <b>ɔʋa</b> [ ˩ ˩ ], <b>etuɽɛ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ], <b>ete</b> [ ˩ ˩ ] <b>ɔha</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] and <b>eɣitã</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ]. As the relations of two strings to one another are always considered, these names are usually com- bined, e.g. <b>ɔh-ɔɣae</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ] (<b>ɔha</b> ＋ <b>ɔɣae</b>). If both positions are the same, their name is followed by <b>n-abe</b> [ \ ˩ ] “combined”, e.g. <b>ɔkã</b> <b>n-abe</b> [ ˩ ˩ \ ˩ ]. The “code” of this divination gives a fixed sentence for each of these com- binations, and the task of the <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspdiviner is to explain to his client the meaning of the sentences appropriate to the arrangements of seeds. As these represent certain typical situations in life, their corresponding names in the code are often used as idiomatic ( “deep”) expressions for these typical situations, <i>v.</i> <b>eh-ɔɣae</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ] and <b>ɔkãn-abe</b> [ ˩ ˩ \ ˩ ]. The actual throwing of <b>ogwɛga</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ] is done in the following way: “alligator-pepper” (<b>ɛhĩ</b>- <b>ɛ̃do</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˦ ]) is chewed and spat on the instrument, then the client holds <b>uk-iha</b> [ ˥ \ ˩ ], “the mes- senger of the oracle”, also called <b>uta</b> [ ˥ ˩ ], in front of his mouth and asks the master of the oracle (<b>ɔka</b> [ ˩ ˥ ]) his question. The <b>ɔbo</b> then touches all the sixteen seed- halves, saying: <b>w-ɔɽ̃-ɛ̃ʋ̃ɛ</b> <b>n-ɔxaɽe</b> (<b>wɛ</b> [ ˩ ]) [ / / ˩ ˥ / ˩ ] “do you know the word he has said?”, puts <b>uk-iha</b> [ ˥ \ ˩ ] between the strings and throws them so that the <b>ɛɽoɽo</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˥ ] and the cowries fall at his side. <br>

Only when the body is taken to be buried, does the <b>orhiɔ̃</b> leave the house.

<b>ɔbo</b> <b>1</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] (pl. <b>e-</b>) a “doctor”; there are oracle-, witch- and ordeal- doctors as well as those who cure, or make rain. The oracle- doctors are composed of four different groups according to the different kinds of oracles; there are <b>ɔb-ogwɛga</b> [ ˩ ˥ (4-1) ˩ ], <b>ɔb</b>- <b>ewawa</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ˩ ], <b>ɔb-akpɛlɛ</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ˩ ], <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspand <b>ɔb-ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˩ ]. The <b>ɔb</b>- <b>ewawa</b> may be an <b>ɔbo</b> <b>n-ɔz-isɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] “a doctor who chooses seeds”, i.e. one who gives the name of a suspect to each one of several seeds (when trying to find out the perpetrator of an offence), and finds the guilty one by means of <b>ewawa</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ]. The ordeal-doctors, <b>ɔb-itã</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ] are <b>ɔb-it-õfigbɔ̃</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˦ ˩ ] “palm- oil-ordeal-doctor”, <b>ɔb-it-ẽbe</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˧ ] “leaf-ordeal doctor”, or <b>ɔbo</b> <b>n-ɔd-itã</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] (one who knows all sorts of ordeals). The experts for the feather- and sasswood-ordeals have no special name besides that of <b>ɔb-itã</b>. The witch-doctor, <b>ɔbo</b> <b>n-ɔwa</b> <b>n-azɛ̃</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ / ˩ ˥ ] “doctor who gives food to the witches”, also called <b>ɔbo</b> <b>n-ɔy-ada</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] “doctor who goes to the cross-roads”, leads negotiations with witches and pacifies them by gifts of food from his clients. The “curing doctor”, <b>ɔb-odĩ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ], bears no outward sign of his profession, but is usully very competent and cures people for money or for their services. A doctor who makes his diagnosis by looking into his patients’ eyes (in case of illness or “juju-trouble”) is called <b>ɔbo</b> <b>n-ɔmi-ãɽo</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˩ ] i.e. “a doctor who looks eye”. An antisocial individual working with “bad medicines” may be called <b>ɔb-ɛrhia</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] a “spoil- doctor”. A “doctor” who travels round the country and makes a living by it is called <b>ɔbo</b> <b>n-ɔy-eria</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ] “a doctor who goes grazing”. The four types of oracle doctors are represented by different people. The <b>ɔb</b>- <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<b>ogwɛga</b> [ ˩ ˥ (4-1) ˩ ] practises only that sort of oracle. Other doctors may know the method, but they are not called <b>ɔb-ogwɛga</b>. If another doctor does not know the <b>ogwɛga</b>, he may have to call in an <b>ɔb-ogwɛga</b>. The <b>ɔb-ogwɛga</b> is paid for his work, but he is also a farmer, as the money he earns is not a sufficient liveli- hood. The oracle is learned from another <b>ogwɛga</b> doctor (without staying with him); <b>itie</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] (the code) is said to take at least three months to learn. After this, <b>eria</b> [ ˩ ˥ ], the analysis of the code-words, is learnt. That is said to take more than six months. If a man is too keen on learning <b>eria</b> so that he starts on it before knowing <b>itie</b> pro- perly, he is supposed never to learn <b>itie</b> correctly. Then he is called: <b>ɔʋ̃a</b> <b>n-ɔgu-eria</b> <b>xɛ‿iha</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] “a man who knows analysis waits for the oracle, i.e. the calling out”. An <b>ewawa</b> learner must be a servant under a doctor. The <b>ewawa</b> doctor, who is always an <b>Osũ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] priest, also undertakes cures, but they are not as good as the <b>ɔb-odĩ</b>. Most of them also give food to witches. Their servant is called <b>ohãgbã</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ] or <b>ɔwaisɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ]. The ap- prenticeship takes four to seven years because the pupils learn cures at the same time. <b>Ewawa</b> doctors are payed with money and they only farm when they have a big family. They make many charms, e.g. some for traders ensuring good husiness, some warding off danger for travellers, some against witches for sick people, etc. Especially <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspa charm “mentioning a man’s name” (<b>ɛb-usueni</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ˩ ] “name- mentioning charm”) and a charm speaking by itself (<b>oʋi‿ɛɽ̃i^</b> <b>ʋ̃i</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˦ ˩ ] “son of the Under- world”) procure them more clients than the other oracle doctors have. This fact, together with their acting as witch doctors, enables them to make a living by being doctors only, without additional farm work. Their knowledge of herbs is, however, said to be smaller than that of the <b>eb-ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˩ ]. An <b>ɔb-akpɛlɛ</b> [ ˩ \ ˩ ˩ ] is mostly an <b>Olokũ</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˦ ] priest, i.e. not a priest at a public shrine, but he has a bigger <b>Olokũ</b> shrine in his house than an ordinary <b>Olokũ</b> shrine. Many of his clients come to his <b>Olokũ</b> shrine and bring things for the yearly <b>Olokũ</b> sacrifice (<b>eh-olokũ</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ ˦ ]). The oracle method is learnt in about six months’ time. During this time the pupil keeps his <b>akpɛlɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ] in a pot at his <b>Olokũ</b> shrine (which nearly every adult possesses). Charms are also put into the pot, and the <b>akpɛlɛ</b> has first been charmed by the teacher, a full communal <b>Olokũ</b> priest. Afterwards the <b>akpɛlɛ</b> is put on an <b>ukpabɔ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ] tray and taken to some cross-roads (<b>ada</b> [ ˩ ˩ ]) where it is charmed again and buried with the charm for a fortnight “in order to see the truth”. (<b>Ada</b> being a meet- ing place for witches, spirits, etc., anything hidden there sees them.) <b>Akpɛlɛ</b> and <b>Ogwɛga</b> have to be familiar with witches be- cause they procure food for the witches by indicating pacifica- <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsption sacrifices, <b>ese</b> [ ˩ ˩ ]. After the fortnight, the pupil, having learnt his craft, takes it out and is an <b>ɔb-akpɛlɛ</b>. The <b>ɔb-ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> must be a “priest” of <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˩ ], i.e. <b>Ifa</b> (Yoruba). (But there are no public shrines or priests of <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b>.) <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> is the Yoruba god of palm kernels (and divination), and people from <b>Akurɛ</b> e.g. are more expert in this method than Bini people. A full <b>babalawo</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˥ ] (Yoruba name for the <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> priest) gathers the kernels from the base of <b>ivĩ‿ɔ̃ɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˩ ], “<b>Ɔɽ̃.</b> kernels”, a special sort of oil palm, and gives them to the pupil. The pupil and his family smoothe the kernels by means of a grindstone, wash them with a charm and keep them for three months in a pot of oil. This is called <b>ɔvi-ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˦ ˩ ˩ ] “he has taken the <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b>” (pl. verb). During this time small sacrifices are made to them until the pupil is (financially) able to “take” them. If he has no means he must possibly leave them in the pot for a year. At last, big sacrifices are made over a period of a fortnight during which time the pupil must procure an <b>axwɛxwɛ</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˥ ], i.e. oracle in- strument, of his own. Then the <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> are taken out and are afterwards put on an <b>ukpo</b> [ ˥ ˩ ] (mud bed) on which many cloths have been spread, forming a heap with a shallow cavity at the top. Parrot-tail-feathers are, among other things, added as adornments. The <b>babalawo</b> asks the kernels whether the pupil will live long and be prosperous <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp(i.e. have many children). Only after this installation of the <b>Ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> kernels is the teaching started which takes more than a year, and at the end of which the pupil becomes an <b>ɔb</b>- <b>ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b>. Some of these doctors are farmers, some traders. They also concern themselves with cures, and they also learn about medicines. The oracle plays a part in their cures by naming the leaves to be used in special cases (by quoting previous in- stances). The money given to the <b>ɔb-ɔɽ̃ɔ̃mila</b> does not enable him to live on his practice as is the case with <b>ɔb-ewawa</b>. Ordeal doctors are not priests. <br>

<b>Ɔbo</b> <b>2</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] name of a sib; their headman is the <b>ogi-ugo</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˩ ], and their greeting <b>la‿ɔbo</b> [ ˥ ˥ ˦ ].

<b>ɔdiɔ̃</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] (pl. <b>e-</b>) (1) senior (among some people); <b>m-ɔɽ-ɔdiɔ̃</b> <b>ʋ-ima</b> <b>eha</b> <b>n-ɔxiã</b> <b>na</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˥ ˩ ] I am the senior among us three who are going here. (2) senior, headman, of a sib, in <b>ɔdĩ-ɛ̃gbɛe</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ (4-1) ]; <i>v.</i> <b>ɔka‿ɛgbɛe</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˥ (4-1) ]. (3) pl., age- group of old men; it usually consists of men who are more than fifty years of age; they supervise manual work in the village, entertain strangers, and perform the village sacrifices at the <b>ɔgw-ediɔ̃</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˦ ], their meeting place, which is also the shrine of the deceased <b>ediɔ̃</b> [ ˩ ˥ ] of the community. They prepared <b>ɛbo</b> [ ˩ \ ] for the safe return of the <b>iɣele</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˩ ] in case of war. The <b>ediɔ̃</b> <b>n-enɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ \ ˩ ], the four elders, also called <b>ikadɛl-enɛ</b> [ ˥ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˥ ], the four pillars, are the four men who are in control of the internal affairs of a village. These do not necessarily include a chief re- siding in the village. Their head is the <b>ɔdiɔ̃-weɽe</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˥ ], the most senior man in the village, and the three others are called <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<b>ɔzukpogieva</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ], <b>ɔzukpogieha</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ], and <b>ɔzukpogienɛ</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ˩ ]. The <b>ɔdiɔ̃-weɽe</b> gives his orders after consultation with his col- leagues and may impose fines in cases of disobedience, consisting of the seizure of a chicken or a goat. His power has been much weakened with the young gene- ration. He is given a special share of the percentage of tax refunded to the village, of killed animals, and of any royalty that may be paid to the village, e.g. by a timber company, and the other members of the <b>ediɔ̃</b> <b>n-enɛ</b> also receive a share in proportion to their seniority, before the general distribution of the bene- fits begins; <i>v.</i> <b>aɣik-ɔdiɔ̃</b> [ ˩ ˥ ˩ ˥ ], <b>ɔweɽe</b> [ ˩ ˩ ˥ ].

The reason for this term seems to be that the <b>exwae</b> and <b>oko</b> belong to the doctor’s <b>Osũ</b> at his home but that they represent the witches in the case referred to, because they are supposed to “send” the food to the witches. “The ones senior to doctors” would, then, refer to the witches; <i>cf.</i> <b>diɔ̃</b> [ / ]. <br>
