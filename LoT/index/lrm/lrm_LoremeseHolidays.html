    <p>Loremese holidays are established by the Synod on a national level. As a traditionally Saulist, which is to say sun-worshipping, country, most public holidays are holy to Saulism and celebrate astronomical events. Dates are fixed on the <a href="/m/xadrezo/boryaworld-calendar">Loremese calendar</a>. With one notable exception, holidays are set to occur on either Mondays or Fridays to maximise long weekends.</p>
    <h3 class="title">New Year's Day</h3>
    <p>New Year's Day occurs on 1 Praveson and celebrates the northward equinox.</p>
	<h3 class="title">Harvest Day</h3>
	<p>Harvest Day is occurs on 8 Triteson. It marks the traditional end of the harvest season and includes a large feast.</p>
	<h3 class="title">Celestial Birthdays</h3>
	<p>The Celestial Birthdays are the two interconnected holidays of the Birthday of the Sun and the Birthday of the Moon. The Birthday of the Sun occurs on 1 Pravozeimon and celebrates the northern solstice, conventionally the shortest day of the year. It is the holiest day of Saulism and is associated with communal outdoor prayers and gift giving.</p>
	<p>The Birthday of the Moon occurs on the Monday on or after the first new moon of Pravozeimon and constitutes the third holiest day of Saulism. If the Birthday of the Moon were to occur on the same day as the Birthday of the Sun, the double holiday of the Birthday of the Sky is celebrated on 1 and 2 Pravozeimon instead, making it the only Loremese holiday to occur on a Tuesday. Whereas the date was historically determined by direct observation, nowadays the date of the new moon is calculated via moon tables. The currently accepted algorithm was introduced approximately 500 years ago.</p>
	<p>Dates for the Birthday of the Moon in the following years are:<br>
	22 Pravozeimon 3237<br>
	15 Pravozeimon 3238<br>
	8 Pravozeimon 3239<br>
	22 Pravozeimon 3240<br>
	8 Pravozeimon 3241</p>
