    <p>Azkali State (Azkali: Azkali Herria; Inori: Aścali Heriścae; Hakainaki: Afukali Etorifun) was a country in southern Ukilen, with an area of approximately [placeholder] square miles. The Azkali State shared borders with Sunteria and Baphia to the west and north respectively, as well as maritime borders with Loremesia and Hallei to the west and southwest. At its peak, the Azkali State had a population of over 42 million, concentrated mostly in the west of the country. Its capital was the city of Chekearoa, and its largest and most influential city was Otzeipao.

	<p>The Azkali State was first declared on the 19th of August 1967, following the unification of the three largest Azkali nations at the time: the Grand Duchy of Otzeipao-Chekearoken, the Independent State of Azkali, and the Azkali Republic in late 1966. The Azkali State was unstable, and faced several revolts and separatist movements throughout its existence.
