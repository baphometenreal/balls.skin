    <p>The United Republic of Baphia is a country that takes up the majority of the Northern Eeh continent (known as Ukilen). It is primarily made of plains (steppes) and desert, with mountainous regions to the east. It used to also comprise outlying islands including Hallei, Pyatle, Sakle, and Jyosti, but they recently gained independence during the civil war. It borders Azkali, Sunteria, Jkawi, and they share a maritime border with Hallei, Sakle, Jyosti, and Kalitana. Its system of government can easily fit into most definitions of a republic; voting for representatives to vote on issues; each province has 3 representatives, 2 to the winning party, and 1 to the second place winning party. The official languages of Baphia are; Baphian, Noellastani, and a 3rd and 4th language decided by each province, if they want to, for example both provinces encompassing Turku recognize their specific dialects of Baphian and Noellastani as their extra 2 languages.
