    <h1>Charlotine Education Systems</h1>
    <p><b>Rudimentary (ages 3 to 5)</b> <br> Fundamental, early childhood education. Officially, rudimentary level education begins when a child turns three years old, and at this point the child has entered the Charlotinian education system and, according to law, can now only exit once they have completed their tertiary or specializing education. At the rudimentary level, children learn key social skills and basic mathematics, science, and langauge, with the primary intention of setting them on the right track for the next level of education. Children will learn the basics of maintaining their own health, like washing hands and brushing teeth. Certain activities such as bathroom training, which should have already been initiated by the children’s caretakers by law, are reinforced through various practices. Rudimentary education in Charlotina is most comparable to nursery schooling in the West, but establishments for rudimentary education also specialize in daycare services, as caretakers’ legal entitlement to a leave following childbirth ends when rudimentary education is supposed to begin. Rudimentary is the shortest level of education.

      <b>Primary (ages 5 to 11)</b> <br> Primary school is the level of education where students will learn off of the foundations in mathematics, science, and language with which they were provided at the rudimentary level. Primary school classes are divided in a broad manner so that students obtain basic knowledge in mathematics, the sciences, language and literature, history, the arts, etc. and so that students will begin to think about the courses in which they will enroll once they reach the secondary level. Primary school is split into two parts: elementary and exploratory. Elementary, the first half of the primary level, focuses on providing students with that core knowledge. In the latter half, known as the exploratory years, there is more of a focus on giving students the opportunity to discover which subjects most intrigue them so that they know what they’d like to enroll in at the secondary level. The exploratory years see classes become slightly smaller and more particular to facilitate this sort of thinking. Primary school is most comparable to elementary or primary school, including middle school.

      <b>Secondary (ages 11 to 17)</b> <br> Secondary students will start to branch out into more specific areas of study, and eventually will prepare for rigorous tertiary education, known commonly as the specialization level. Secondary students will still receive general yet complex education in several core fields, like calculus or physics, which serve to compliment their elected courses. Elected courses are chosen by students, and every year of schooling requires students to have two elected classes (there are seven classes in a day). Elected courses are generally more advanced than the core courses; they are analogous to AP or honors courses taught in our world. Just like primary school, secondary school is split into two parts: organizational and preparatory. The first three years of secondary schooling, known as the organizational stage, is where students start their secondary education and grow accustomed to the complexity of reality; they “organize” their life and begin to apply skills learned in school into the real world so that they are able to function not necessarily independently, but properly nonetheless. All students will learn how to utilize public transportation, participate in government, organize and keep a clean living space, and so on. The following preparatory stage continues the processes of the organizational stage, but accomodates for tertiary school preparation by allowing students’ schedules to consist of more elected courses, now up to four. In the fourth year of secondary school, these additional elected courses are not obligatory so that uncertain students may still explore general courses. In the fifth year they become obligatory, but the fourth elected course can be replaced with another core course, if arrangements are made. By the sixth year, all students must use their four elected courses, with no exceptions. Secondary school is most comparable to high school or secondary school.
