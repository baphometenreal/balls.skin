You can for the most part use each interchanigbly.",
  "ttgenq": "Genuine question. /genq is used in situations where you want to convey that the question you are asking is genuine and not meant as a joke. Example: 'Is grilled cheese your favourite food? /genq'. /gq may be confusing, so i'd suggest using /genq.",
  "tts": "Sarcastic. /s is used in situations where you want to convey that you are sarcastic and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /s'. /sarcastic may be the better option but /s is much more used. It is one of the oldest tone tags.",
  "ttj": "Joke. /j is used in situations where you want to convey that you are joking and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /j'. /joke may be the better option but /j is much more used. It is one of the oldest tone tags.",

Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /hj'. /hj has alot of supporters and haters, bc it may be unclear what part of the joke is meant to be serious. for some people that negates it usefulness and others it is very useful. /halfjoke may be the better option but /hj is much more used.",
