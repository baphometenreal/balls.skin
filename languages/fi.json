  "ttwarn": "This is not an exhaustive list, but it is as exhaustive as I can manage. Tags with an astrisk (*) mean they are the most important and crucial (in my opinion) to know. Tonetags aren't slang, they are used to convey tone where text usually falls flat by itself, it's meant as a tool to help in those cases, and you shouldn't use them as jokes for this reason. These are ordered by how often I found them and and are grouped together if they are similar, have similar meanings, ect. [the following is for non english languages] Due to how tonetags work in other languages, this list will only have the english forms of tonetags and their translated definitions.",
  "ttsources": "Sources:",
  "ttgen": "Genuine. /gen is used in situations where you want to make it clear what you are saying is genuine. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /gen'. /g may be confusing, so i'd suggest using /gen. /gen has a similar meaning to /srs, but the conotation is different. You can for the most part use each interchanigbly.",
  "ttgenq": "Genuine question. /genq is used in situations where you want to convey that the question you are asking is genuine and not meant as a joke. Example: 'Is grilled cheese your favourite food? /genq'. /gq may be confusing, so i'd suggest using /genq.",
  "tts": "Sarcastic. /s is used in situations where you want to convey that you are sarcastic and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /s'. /sarcastic may be the better option but /s is much more used. It is one of the oldest tone tags.",
  "ttj": "Joke. /j is used in situations where you want to convey that you are joking and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /j'. /joke may be the better option but /j is much more used. It is one of the oldest tone tags.",
  "tthj": "Halfjoke. /hj is used in situations where you want to convey that you are kind of joking and part of what you said should be taken more seriosly than the rest. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /hj'. /hj has alot of supporters and haters, bc it may be unclear what part of the joke is meant to be serious. for some people that negates it usefulness and others it is very useful. /halfjoke may be the better option but /hj is much more used.",
  "ttsrs": "Serious. /srs is used in situations where you want to convey that you are being serious. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /srs'. /srs has a similar meaning to /gen, but the conotation is different. You can for the most part use each interchanigbly.",
  "ttnsrs": "Not serious. /nsrs is used in situations where you want to convey that you are not being serious. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /nsrs'. This tone tag is for the most part redundant unless youre trying to be extra clear.",
  "ttlh": "Lighthearted. /lh is used in situations where you want to convey that you are being light-hearted, not mean. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /lh'.",
  "ttpos": "Positive. /pos is used in situations where you want to convey that what you are saying is meant to be positive. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /pos'. /pos may be confusing, so use one of the other alternatives, it's just that /pos is more used.",
  "ttneu": "Neutral. /neu is used in situations where you want to convey that what you are saying is meant to be neautral, neither positive or negative. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /neu'.",
  "ttneg": "Negative. /neg is used in situations where you want to convey that what you are saying is meant to be negative. Example: 'Grilled cheese is my favourite food /neg'.",
